# Readable Passphrase Generator #

The Readable Passphrase Generator generates passphrases which are (mostly) grammatically correct but nonsensical.
These are easy to remember (for humans) but difficult to guess (for humans and computers). 

Developed in C# with a KeePass plugin, console app and public API.
Runs wherever the .NET Framework, .NET Core or Mono are available.
